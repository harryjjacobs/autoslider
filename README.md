This is a very simple and basic jQuery automatic image slider that slides through a gallery of images. It has no user controls however the speed at which it goes through the images can be changed. It is very simple to use

This plugin requies jQuery.

You must first create a div to use as the gallery
```html
<div id="gallery"></div>
```
```javascript
$("#gallery").gallery();
```
